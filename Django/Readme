Django Development Setup on Windows + PowerShell

This README explains how to set up and work with Python virtual environments for Django projects on Windows using PowerShell. It also covers activating existing environments and running the Django server.

1. Prerequisites

Python installed (preferably Python 3.10+).

PowerShell (comes with Windows).

Basic knowledge of Python and command line.

Check Python version:

python --version

2. Create a New Django Project
   Step 1: Navigate to your project folder
   cd D:\code\Backend\Python\Django

Step 2: Create a virtual environment
python -m venv myapp

myapp is the name of your virtual environment.

This creates a folder myapp with its own Python and pip.

Step 3: Allow PowerShell to run scripts (first time only)
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

This allows PowerShell to run local scripts safely.

Step 4: Activate the virtual environment
.\myapp\Scripts\Activate.ps1

Your prompt will now show (myapp) at the start.

If you see this, the environment is active.

Step 5: Verify the Python path
where python

Should point to:

D:\code\Backend\Python\Django\myapp\Scripts\python.exe

Step 6: Install Django
pip install django

Step 7: Start a new Django project
django-admin startproject myproject
cd myproject
python manage.py runserver

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser to see the Django welcome page.

3. Working on an Existing Project
   Step 1: Navigate to your project folder
   cd D:\code\Backend\Python\Django\myproject

Step 2: Activate the virtual environment
.\myapp\Scripts\Activate.ps1

(myapp) should appear in the prompt.

Step 3: Install any required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

Only needed if the project has a requirements.txt.

Step 4: Run the Django server
python manage.py runserver

Server will start at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

4. Check if the Virtual Environment is Active

Prompt shows (myapp) at the start.

Run:

where python

Should point to the virtual environmentâ€™s Python.

Run:

pip list

Shows installed packages in this environment.
